## Caution
They are not the best feature for predicting stock value.
Only adjusted close among the all selected features has the direct impact of stock price forecasting here.
It can not be depended on only stock indexs. If it was so easy features to collect data on, then many comapnies will become billioners over night only by simple linear models.
